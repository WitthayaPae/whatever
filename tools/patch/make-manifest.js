/*  Build the mobile patch payload: manifest.json plus a content-addressed
    blob store, ready to upload to /launcher_mobile/ on the patch host.

        node make-manifest.js --version 366 --min-apk 1
        node make-manifest.js --version 366 --verify --prune

        manifest.json          version, minApk, one entry per shipped file
        blobs/<sha256>         the payload, immutable and append-only

    Why content-addressed: uploads only ever ADD files, so there is no CDN
    cache to invalidate and no window where a client can fetch a half-replaced
    file. Rolling back is republishing an older manifest - the blobs it points
    at are still there.

    Why an explicit allowlist and not a directory walk: push-data.sh copies
    whole directories, which is how 352 MB of .bak_pre_* files and 4 GB of
    loose copies of already-packed content ended up on the test device. A file
    ships because it is named here, not because it happened to be in the tree.  */
