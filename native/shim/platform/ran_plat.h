//  The few things that are genuinely per-platform, behind one door.
//
//  Everything else in shim/ is portable C++ that happens to have been written
//  on Android. These are the exceptions: where diagnostic flags live, and where
//  log lines go. Both were spelled out inline in sixty places, which is fine
//  until a second platform exists - "/sdcard/ran/nulldraw" is not a path iOS
//  has, or could have, since nothing outside an app may write into its sandbox.
//
//  So the flags are named, not pathed, and the root is set once at startup.
