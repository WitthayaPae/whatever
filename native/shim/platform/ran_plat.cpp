//  ===========================================================================
//  Crash reports.
//
//  "The game crashed on my phone" used to be the end of the trail: the log is
//  in logcat (Android) or nowhere (iOS), it is gone by the time anyone asks,
//  and the phone is not on this desk. So the client records its own last run
//  and sends it home.
//
//  The record is a memory-mapped file, lastrun.bin, in the diagnostic root:
//
//      [ 64-byte header | crash text, up to 16 KB | log ring, 128 KB ]
//
//  Mapped, not written: every log line lands in the page cache the moment it
//  is copied, and the kernel writes those pages out even if the process is
//  then SIGKILLed - by the low-memory killer, by iOS's jetsam - which leaves
//  no signal to catch and would otherwise leave nothing at all. A crash signal
//  adds a backtrace to the crash area with nothing but memory stores (no
//  allocation, no stdio), which is what a signal handler may safely do.
//
//  The header carries the run's state: FOREGROUND while the app is on screen,
//  BACKGROUND when it is not, CRASHED from the signal handler, CLEAN on an
//  orderly exit. The next boot reads it before re-arming. CRASHED is a crash;
//  FOREGROUND means the process died while the player was looking at it,
//  without a signal - in practice the system killing it for memory. A death in
//  the background is the player swiping it away, and is not reported.
//
//  The report goes to crash_pending/<time>.txt, as text; each platform layer
//  uploads that folder (RanPlat_UploadCrashReports) and deletes what the
//  server accepted. Built here, once, so Android and iOS cannot disagree about
//  what a report says.
