//  The on-screen touch controls: a movement stick, an attack ring, and pinch to
//  zoom.
//
//  These live above the client rather than inside its UI system. They are input
//  transducers - their whole job is to turn a touch into something the client
//  already understands - and keeping them out of the game code means SOURCE
//  stays byte-identical to the PC build.
//
//  Touches are offered here first. A control that owns a touch claims it and the
//  client never sees it; everything else falls through unchanged, so tapping the
//  world or the game's own windows still works.

//  extern "C" on every entry point, and it is not decoration: ran_ios_main.mm
//  declares these inside an extern "C" block, so a C++-linkage definition here
//  gives the linker a mangled name to look for and an unmangled one to find.
//  That was five undefined symbols at the end of an otherwise complete iOS
//  build. Android never noticed because android_main.cpp includes this header
//  and agreed with it either way.
