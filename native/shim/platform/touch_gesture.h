//  The touch-to-mouse gesture layer, shared by every platform.
//
//  This used to live inside platform/android/android_main.cpp, which meant iOS
//  had none of it: a touch there pressed the left button on the way down and
//  released it on the way up, so there was no long press, no drag, no camera
//  look, no window dragging and no pinch. Everything the Android build had
//  learned about touch was in a file iOS does not compile.
//
//  Nothing in here is Android-specific. The platform layer's whole job is to
//  turn its own events into coordinates and call these four functions.
