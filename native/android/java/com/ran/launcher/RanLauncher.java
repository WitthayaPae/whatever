    /* ------------------------------------------------------------ apk update
     *
     *  Native code cannot ride the payload. Since Android 10 an app targeting
     *  API 29 or above may not dlopen a library out of its own writable
     *  storage - W^X - and this one targets 34. A code fix therefore reaches a
     *  player only as a new APK, and this is what installs it.
     *
     *  Every step of that is somewhere to be careful, so:
     *
     *  *  The APK's hash comes out of manifest.json, which is verified against
     *     a key compiled into this APK before it is even parsed. The bytes are
     *     authenticated, not merely un-corrupted, and that holds over plain
     *     HTTP to a bare IP - the property the data blobs already have.
     *
     *  *  It is fetched from blobs/<sha256>, content-addressed like everything
     *     else. The manifest never names a path here, so there is no traversal
     *     surface and nothing new to validate.
     *
     *  *  The bytes stream straight into a PackageInstaller session and are
     *     hashed on the way through. They are never a file on disk that this
     *     app, or any other, could swap between the check and the install -
     *     which is the hole every download-verify-install sequence has.
     *
     *  *  A mismatch abandons the session, so a wrong or truncated body is
     *     discarded rather than handed to the installer.
     *
     *  *  Only a strictly newer versionCode is offered. An old manifest stays
     *     validly signed forever, so without this a replay could walk a player
     *     back to a version whose bugs are known.
     *
